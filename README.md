# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **NIFTY stock market returns** using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** and **feature engineering techniques** to analyze stock price movements.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, converts dates, and normalizes data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Computes stock price change over different time periods.
- **Model Training**: Uses **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** for prediction.
- **Binary Classification**: Converts predictions into up/down movement labels.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measures accuracy and analyzes return trends.
- **Visualization**: Plots actual vs. predicted returns for the last 30 days.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset contains historical NIFTY stock prices.
- File: **NIFTY.csv** (automatically downloaded via `gdown`).
- Columns: **Date, Open, High, Low, Close**.
